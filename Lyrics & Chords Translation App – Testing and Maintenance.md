## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Test coverage for critical components:

- ChordPro parser: Edge cases, malformed input
- Transposition: All keys, slash chords, enharmonics
- URL parsing: Invalid formats, missing songs
- Section breaking: Various section sizes
- Search: Special characters, empty results

### Integration Testing

End-to-end flows:

- Search → Select → Build setlist → Share
- Open shared URL → Transpose → Navigate sections
- Admin: Add song → Preview → Save → Search → Display
- Performance mode: Activate → Navigate → Exit

### Performance Testing

Metrics to monitor:

- Time to first paint: <1 second
- Search response: <200ms
- Transposition: <50ms
- Section snap: Native smooth
- Setlist with 20 songs: <2 second load

### Accessibility Testing

Compliance checks:

- Keyboard navigation through all features
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios (especially dark mode)
- Touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Focus indicators visible

### Browser/Device Testing

Priority matrix:

- Mobile Safari: Critical (iOS users)
- Chrome Mobile: Critical (Android users)
- Desktop Chrome: Important (admin use)
- Desktop Firefox: Important
- Desktop Safari: Nice to have
- Tablet browsers: Nice to have

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Metrics

Track via server logs:

- Page load times by route
- Search query performance
- Most accessed songs
- Popular key transpositions
- Setlist sizes distribution

### Error Tracking

Log and alert on:

- ChordPro parse failures
- Database connection issues
- Missing songs in setlists
- Invalid transposition requests
- Client-side JavaScript errors

### Usage Analytics

Understand user behavior:

- Search terms (anonymized)
- Feature usage (performance mode, etc.)
- Sharing patterns
- Admin activity
- Mobile vs desktop split

### Health Checks

Automated monitoring:

- Database connectivity
- Search functionality
- Render pipeline
- Admin access
- SSL certificate expiry

## Maintenance Considerations

### Database Maintenance

Regular tasks:

- Update search vectors after bulk changes
- Vacuum and analyze for performance
- Backup before schema changes
- Archive old/unused songs

### Content Management

Administrative workflows:

- Review songs with parse warnings
- Standardize section naming
- Update YouTube/streaming links
- Merge duplicate songs
- Batch fix common issues

### Performance Optimization

Ongoing improvements:

- Monitor slow queries
- Optimize image assets
- Review CSS/JS bundle sizes
- Cache static resources
- CDN for assets if needed

### Security Updates

Regular security tasks:

- Update dependencies monthly
- Review admin access logs
- Rotate secrets annually
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Keep SSL certificates current
