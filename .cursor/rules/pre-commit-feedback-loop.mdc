When it comes to code, the user already has a set of helpful automations the boost the value of your output.
Those rules are described in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](mdc:.pre-commit-config.yaml).
You don't need to execute them manually, but rather to launch the hooks.
This is done with the `pre-commit run` command. Note that it will only ever consider staged changes. That behavior is required by user.
After running the command, the hooks will change the source code, but won't stage it. You'll need to re-stage them again for the hooks to actually see the changes.
There will be a number of manual lints the will require your undivided attention.
After applying all the fixes, you'll need to stage them and re-run the hooks.
Apply the fixes in bulk, to use the tool calling efficiently.

Run this feedback loop until every check passes.
YOU MUST FIX EVERYTHING. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO IGNORE ANY ERRORS.
